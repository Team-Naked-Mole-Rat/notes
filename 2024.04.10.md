# Team BLIND MOLE RAT (start day on frontend, end day on backend)

Ansel / Richard

Richard navigates while Ansel drives.

(1)  Setup REACT-ROUTER-DOM routes (follow Ansel design, minimum of 2 pages)

(2)  Setup REACT-ROUTER-DOM to route between pages using a navigation menu

(3)  Finalize if using RTK/REDUX or plain REACT.  Take into consideration project requirements.

Stretch Goals:
  (a)  Consider using JWT for PROTECTED routes for REACT-ROUTER-DOM  (Protected routes for managing roles on client side)
  (b)  LOGIN/SIGNUP pages should send :

              {
                user: {
                  username: USERNAME,
                  password:  PASSWORD,
                },
                token:  "NONE"
              }

      PROCEED TO APP ON RECEIPT OF: 
              {
                user: {
                  username: USERNAME,
                  password:  PASSWORD,
                  roles: ['user', 'admin']
                },
                token:  "NONE"
              }

Yang / Ksenia

Yang naviages while Ksenia drives

## GOALS:

GOAL1a:  Use Yang's researcht to setup LOGIN/SIGNUP and a database (SQL).
GOAL1b:  Setup a REMOTE SQL server and a LOCALHOST SQL server (for dev)
GOAL2:  Using postman, create LOGIN/SIGNUJP features.

(1)   Using postman setup a LOGIN endpoint in an auth router (/auth/login).  Data received should be of:

              {
                user: {
                  username: USERNAME,     // array of username
                  password:  PASSWORD,             // array of roles
                },
                token:  "JWCTOKEN"
              }
      END of middleware path (/auth/login) should send:

              {
                user: {
                  username: USERNAME,
                  password:  PASSWORD,
                  roles: ['user', 'admin']
                },
                token:  "JWT"
              }

  (a)  for the LOGIN setup a middleware path that goes through routers such as "jwt" / "session" (but no actions happen if unachievable in timeframe)

(2)   Using POSTMAN, setup a SIGNUP endpoint in an auth router (/auth/signup).  Data receives should be of:

              {
                user: {
                  username: USERNAME,
                  password:  PASSWORD,
                },
                token:  "NONE"
              }

      END of middleware path (/auth/signup) should send:

              {
                user: {
                  username: USERNAME,
                  password:  PASSWORD,
                  roles: ['user', 'admin']
                },
                token:  "JWT"
              }

  (a) for the SIGNUP setup a middleware path that goes through routers such as "jwt" / "session" (but no actions happen if unachievable in timeframe)





Stretch goals: 
  (a) setup password hashing
